Idea:
    - Create Kubernetes APIs server in golang initially in RESTFUL. In Second version convert into gRPC.
        + Fetching all the objects in a perticular Namespaces.
            - Using lables and slector(service, nodes, pods, secrets, deplopuments, volumes)
        + Create resources
            - Pods, deployments, services, volumes, role base, ingress.
    - Create frontend in NEXT.js
